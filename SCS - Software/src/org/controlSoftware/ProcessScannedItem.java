		DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT:
			- the graphical user interface
			- **** products without barcodes ****
			- credit/debit cards
			- returning change to the customer
		
		Assuming there is a HashMap that acts as a dictionary for all the items that can be scanned via barcode.
		
		1) We are given a barcode from the barcode scanner
		
		2) Lookup Barcode in BarcodedProduct dictionary to get PRICE
			- Hashmap with its key = BARCODE and value = ItemProduct
				- ItemProduct is a wrapper class that combines BarcodedItem and BarcodedProduct objects into one
			- If barcode cannot be found in dictionary then notify the user via the touch screen and stop
		
		3) Get the price from BarcodedProduct
		
		4) Check if the product is priced per unit or by per KG
			- If by unit, just add the price to the customer's current total
			- Otherwise get the weight (in KG) of the item and multiply that by the product's price and add this to the customers total 
			
		5) Wait X number of seconds for some signal from the scale that the customer has placed the item in the bagging area
			- If X number of seconds pass without being signaled by the scale, block scanning and touch screen input until signal is received or employee override
		
		6) Done
